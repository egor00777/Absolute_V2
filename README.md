# Absolute_V2
Software for automated work with a PC. Absolute provides voice control of the PC, without the need for a direct Internet connection. P.S. Do you remember Jarvis from the movies? That's what he is.

IMPORTANT!! before launching, you need to download the Vosk language model for the Russian language (It can be either a large or a small model)

To work correctly, unpack the model into the "re_sp" folder and rename it to "ru_model"
